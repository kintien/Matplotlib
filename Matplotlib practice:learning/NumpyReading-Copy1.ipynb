    "### Slicing ndarrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being able to access individual elements one at a time, NumPy provides a way to access subsets of ndarrays. This is known as **slicing**. Slicing is performed by combining indices with the colon symbol inside the square brackets `[ : ]`. In general you will come across three types of slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ndarray[start:end]`\n",
    "2. `ndarray[start:]`\n",
    "3. `ndarray[:end]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is used to select elements between the start and end indices. The second method is used to select all elements from the start index till the last index. The third method is used to select all elements from the first index till the end index. We should note that in methods one and three, the end index is excluded. We should also note that since ndarrays can be multidimensional, when doing slicing you usually have to specify a slice for each dimension of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now see some examples of how to use the above methods to select different subsets of a rank 2 ndarray."

    "### Arithmatic Operations and Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy allows element-wise operations on ndarrays as well as matrix operations. In order to do element-wise operations, NumPy sometimes uses something called **Broadcasting**. Broadcasting is the term used to describe how NumPy handles element-wise arithmetic operations with ndarrays of different shapes. For example, broadcasting is used implicitly when doing arithmetic operations between scalars and ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by doing element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, between ndarrays. To do this, NumPy provides a functional approach, where we use functions such as np.add(), or by using arithmetic symbols, such as +, that resembles more how we write mathematical equations. Both forms will do the same operation, the only difference is that if you use the function approach, the functions usually have options that you can tweak using keywords. It is important to note that when performing element-wise operations, the shapes of the ndarrays being operated on, must have the same shape or be broadcastable. Consider the following example: "

    "As you can see, NumPy is able to add 1 x 3 and 3 x 1 ndarrays to 3 x 3 ndarrays by broadcasting the smaller ndarrays along the big ndarray so that they have compatible shapes. In general, NumPy can do this provided that the smaller ndarray, such as the 1 x 3 ndarray in our example, can be expanded to the shape of the larger ndarray in such a way that the resulting broadcast is unambiguous."
